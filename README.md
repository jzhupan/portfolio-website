# portfolio-website
New repo for my portfolio website
Creating my website with vanilla JavaScript to be able to design it more freely.


The website will contain my notable projects that I made including my final project from my JavaScript bootcamp and a financial dashboard I made studying react with other frameworks and libraries.
