## My Portfolio Website

New repo for my portfolio website
Creating my website with vanilla JavaScript to be able to design and style it freely.

The website will contain my notable projects that I made including:
○ Image to Text Translator App
○ Financial dashboard I made studying React/Next.js with other frameworks and libraries.
